# About me
I like to solve mathematical as well as engineering problems, and translate the solutions into computer code. I am currently a PhD candidate in Scientific Computing, specialization in Numerical Analysis, at Uppsala University in Sweden. My research area covers analysis and implementation of numerical methods for solving partial differential equations to high order of accuracy. Since 2017, I have been involved into the project [INVIVE](https://www.it.uu.se/research/scientific_computing/project/rbf/biomech), where we have been using mathematics to forecast the behavior of the [thoracic diaphragm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm) when a human patient is exposed to the mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.
