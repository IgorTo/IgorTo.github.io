# About me
I like to solve mathematical as well as engineering problems, and translate the solutions into computer code. I am currently a PhD candidate in Scientific Computing, specialization in Numerical Analysis, at Uppsala University in Sweden. My research area covers analysis and implementation of numerical methods for solving partial differential equations to high order of accuracy. Since 2017, I have been involved in [INVIVE](https://www.it.uu.se/research/scientific_computing/project/rbf/biomech), a project where we use mathematics to forecast the behavior of the [thoracic diaphragm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_diaphragm) when a human patient is exposed to mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit.
