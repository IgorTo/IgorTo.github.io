# About me
Currently I am a **postdoctoral researcher at Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University**. My research is focused on analyzing and developing numerical algorithms for solving partial differential equations that find applications in continental ice sheet modeling.

I hold a Ph.D. degree in Scientific Computing with specialization in Numerical Analysis from Uppsala University, Sweden. 

I previously held a position in industry where I worked as Senior Software and Algorithm developer at Qamcom Research and Technology.

# Research interests
- Theoretical analysis of numerical algorithms that "work but lack mathematical rigour".
- Partial differential equations.
- Finite element methods.
- Radial basis function methods.
- PDE model coupling.
- Computational glaciology.
- Computational biomechanics.
